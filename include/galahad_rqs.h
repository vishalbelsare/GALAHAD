  \section rqs_intro Introduction

  \subsection rqs_purpose Purpose

  Given real \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrices \f$H\f$ and \f$M\f$
  (with \f$M\f$  diagonally dominant), another real \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$
  matrix \f$A\f$, a real \f$n\f$ vector \f$c\f$ and scalars \f$\sigma>0\f$,
  \f$p>2\f$ and \f$f\f$, this package
  finds an <b>approximate minimizer of the regularised quadratic
  objective function \f$\frac{1}{2} x^T H x + c^T x + f +
  \frac{1}{p} \sigma \|x\|_M^p\f$, where the vector \f$x\f$ may
  additionally be required to satisfy \f$A x = 0\f$,</b> and where
  the \f$M\f$-norm of \f$x\f$ is \f$\|x\|_M = \sqrt{x^T M x}\f$.
  This problem commonly occurs as a subproblem in nonlinear
  optimization calculations.  The matrix \f$M\f$ need not be provided in
  the commonly-occurring \f$\ell_2\f$-regularisation case for which
  \f$M =  I\f$, the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ identity matrix.

  Factorization of matrices of the form \f$H + \lambda M\f$---or
  \f[\mbox{(1)}\;\;\; \mat{cc}{ H + \lambda M & A^T \\ A & 0}\f]
\manonly
\n
    (1)      ( H + lambda M   A^T )
             (     A           0  )
\n
\endmanonly
  in cases where \f$A x = 0\f$ is imposed---for a succession of
  scalars \f$\lambda\f$ will be required, so this package is most suited for
  the case where such a factorization may be found efficiently. If this is
  not the case, the GALAHAD package \c GLRT may be preferred.

  \subsection rqs_method Method

  The required solution \f$x_*\f$ necessarily satisfies the optimality
  condition \f$H x_* + \lambda_* M x_* + A^T y_* + c = 0\f$ and
  \f$A x_* = 0\f$, where \f$\lambda_* = \sigma\|x_*\|^{p-2}\f$
  is a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the
  regularisation and \f$y_*\f$ are Lagrange multipliers for the linear
  constraints \f$A x = 0\f$, if any.  In addition in all cases, the
  matrix \f$H + \lambda_* M\f$ will be positive semi-definite on the
  null-space of \f$A\f$; in most instances it will actually be positive
  definite, but in special ``hard'' cases singularity is a possibility.

  The method is iterative, and proceeds in two phases.  Firstly, lower and
  upper bounds, \f$\lambda_L\f$ and
  \f$\lambda_U\f$, on \f$\lambda_*\f$ are computed using
  Gershgorin's theorems and other eigenvalue bounds. The first phase of
  the computation proceeds by progressively shrinking the bound interval
  \f$[\lambda_L,\lambda_U]\f$
  until a value \f$\lambda\f$ for which \f$\|x(\lambda)\|_M \geq \sigma
  \|x(\lambda)\|_M^{p-2}\f$ is found.  Here \f$x(\lambda)\f$ and its
  companion \f$y(\lambda)\f$ are defined to be a solution of
  \f[\mbox{(2)}\;\;\; (H + \lambda M)x(\lambda)
   + A^T y(\lambda) = - c \;\mbox{and}\; A x(\lambda) = 0.\f]
\manonly
\n
   (2)    (H + lambda M)x(lambda) + A^T y(lambda) = - c and
                      A x(lambda) = 0.
\n
\endmanonly
  Once the terminating \f$\lambda\f$ from the first phase has been discovered,
  the second phase consists of applying Newton or higher-order iterations
  to the nonlinear ``secular'' equation
  \f$\|x(\lambda)\|_M = \sigma \|x(\lambda)\|_M^{p-2}\f$ with
  the knowledge that such iterations are both globally and ultimately
  rapidly convergent. It is possible in the ``hard'' case that the
  interval in the first-phase will shrink to the single point \f$\lambda_*\f$,
  and precautions are taken, using inverse iteration with Rayleigh-quotient
  acceleration to ensure that this too happens rapidly.

  The dominant cost is the requirement that we solve a sequence of linear
  systems (2). In the absence of linear constraints, an efficient
  sparse Cholesky factorization with precautions to detect indefinite
  \f$H + \lambda M\f$ is used. If \f$A x = 0\f$ is required, a sparse
  symmetric, indefinite factorization of (1) is used rather than a
  Cholesky factorization.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ and scaling matrix \f$M\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).
  In what follows, we refer to \f$H\f$ but this applies equally to \f$M\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.
