%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% parallel usage %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Parallel usage}
OpenMP may be used by the {\tt \fullpackagename} package to provide
parallelism for some solvers in shared memory environments.
To run in parallel, OpenMP
must be enabled at compilation time by using the correct compiler flag
(usually some variant of {\tt -openmp}).
The number of threads may be controlled at runtime
by setting the environment variable {\tt OMP\_NUM\_THREADS}.

\noindent
The code may be compiled and run in serial mode.
